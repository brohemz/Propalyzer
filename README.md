**Time to get up and running = less than 10 minutes**

Web app that helps investors evaluate investment property opportunities. The user inputs a US residential property address and the app uses Zillow's API to pull property details. The app presents the property details to the user for inspection and the ability to edit. With the details finalized, the app will crunch the data and return information about the property including:
- Operating Income
- Operating Expenses
- Cash on Cash Return
- Debt Coverage Ratio
- Monthly Cash Flow
- Scoring of area Livability, Crime, Cost of Living, Education, Employment, Housing, Weather relative to local and national averages
- Localized natural disaster information
- Local School information

```
$ mkdir [directory name]
$ pip install virtualenv
$ cd [directory name]

**The project includes two "secret.py" files - one for the API keys and the other for the settings.py secret key. 
The secret.py files are included in the .gitignore file so don't worry about accidentally uploading your API keys**

- Create a secret.py file in the 'Propalyzer/propalyzer_site/propalyzer_app' folder and enter the following:
```
class Secret():
  ZWSID = '[enter your Zillow key here without brackets]'
  GSCHOOL_API_KEY = '[enter your GreatSchools key here without brackets]'
## now save the file ##
```
- Create a second secret.py file in the 'Propalyzer/propalyzer_site/propalyzer_site' folder and enter the following:
```
class Secret():
  SECRET_KEY = '[enter a secret key here without brackets - any random string of characters will work!]'
## now save the file ##
```
- Install packages from requirements.txt file

```
$ source env/bin/activate (run this from the directory you created to activate the virtual environment)
$ pip install -r Propalyzer/requirements.txt
```
- Prep the SQLite database
```
$ cd Propalyzer/propalyzer_site
$ python manage.py makemigrations propalyzer_app
$ python manage.py migrate
```
- Create superuser
```
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- Run local webserver and test the home page
